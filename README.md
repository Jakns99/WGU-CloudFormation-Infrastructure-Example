# WGU-CloudFormation-Infrastructure-Example
This project is part of my AWS Cloud Capstone Project at Western Governor's University
It is meant to showcase a simple example of how a Managed Service Provider (MSP) - *CloudNet Technologies* can modernize its traditional, manual infrastructure deployment methodology by investing in Infrastructure as Code with AWS CloudFormation

## Project Overview
CloudNet Technologies has previously only deployed customer infrastructure manually, which was time consuming, costly, and error-prone.
Infrastructure as Code automates the process by provisioning a complete, production-grade AWS environment, with servers, databases, security, monitoring, and more, using a single CloudFormation Template.
